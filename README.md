1.In second year computer engineering class, group A student’s play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python program using functions to compute following: - a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)

2.Write a Python program to compute following operations on String: a) To display word with the longest length b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not d) To display index of first appearance of the substring e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

3.Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix: a) Addition of two matrices b) Subtraction of two matrices c) Multiplication of two matrices d) Transpose of a matrix

a) Write a pythonprogram to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search. b) Write a python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search

4.Write a python program to store second year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using a) Insertion sort b) Shell Sort and display top five scores

5.Write a python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display top five scores.

6.Write C++ program for storing appointment schedule for day. Appointments are booked randomly using linked list. Set start and end time and min and max duration for visit slot. Write functions fora) Display free slots b) Book appointment c) Cancel appointment ( check validity, time bounds, availability) d) Sort list based on time e) Sort list based on time using pointer manipulation

7.Write C++ program for storing binary number using doubly linked lists. Write functions a) To compute 1‘s and 2‘s complement b) Add two binary numbers

8.In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized or not

9.Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation using stack based on given conditions:

10.Operands and operator, both must be single character.
Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected

11.Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.
